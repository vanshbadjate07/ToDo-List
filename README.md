# Java Applet To-Do List UI

## Overview
This project is a Java-based UI application that represents a basic to-do list interface using the `java.applet` and `java.awt` packages. It is designed to demonstrate graphical shapes, colors, and interactions in Java Applets. 

### Features:
- Custom UI design using various `Graphics` methods.
- Demonstrates the use of polygons, arcs, and rectangles.
- Interactive background colors and object placements.

## Requirements
- Java Development Kit (JDK) installed.
- An IDE that supports Applet execution or a browser plugin for running applets (Note: Applets are deprecated in modern browsers, so itâ€™s recommended to use a local Java IDE).

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/todo-list-applet.git
    ```
2. Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
3. Compile and run the applet:
    - Ensure the applet code is in a `.java` file.
    - If using an IDE, run the applet directly from the IDE.
    - If using a browser plugin, you can use the provided applet HTML code for execution.
    
4. The to-do list UI will be displayed with various graphics elements.

## Applet HTML Tag
To run the applet in a browser (with Java plugin support), use this HTML:
```html
<applet code="todo_list.class" width="1000" height="1000"> </applet>
